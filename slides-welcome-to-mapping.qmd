### Why making maps with R makes sense

R is a complete GIS tool

### Two types of data: vector and raster. We'll mostly cover vector.

### Make simple maps with ggplot and mapview

#### Access Data

```{r}
library(rnaturalearth)

ne_countries()
```

#### Make simple map with ggplot

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

ne_countries() |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf()
```

#### Make simple map with mapview

```{r}
library(mapview)

ne_countries() |>
  mapview()
```
