```{r}
library(tidyverse)

city_councilors <-

```

```{r}
city_councilors
```

library(sf)

city_council_districts <-

city_council_districts
```

---

```{r}
library(mapview)

city_council_districts |>
  mapview()
```

### Joing CSV and `sf` Object {.inverse}

#### `left_join()`

```{r}
left_join(
  city_councilors,
  city_council_districts,
  join_by(district)
)
```

---

```{r}
left_join(
  city_councilors,
  city_council_districts,
  join_by(district)
) |>
  st_as_sf()
```

---

```{r}
left_join(
  city_councilors,
  city_council_districts,
  join_by(district)
) |>
  st_as_sf() |>
  mapview()
```

#### `right_join()`

```{r}
right_join(
  city_councilors,
  city_council_districts,
  join_by(district)
) |>
  st_as_sf()
```
