### Geospatial Data Formats: ESRI Shapefile {.inverse}

### ESRI Shapefile

Consists of multiple files: 

1. `.shp`: The main file that contains the geometry data (shapes) of the features.
1. `.shx`: The shape index file, which stores the positional index of the feature geometry to improve access speed.
1. `.dbf`: The attribute format file, which stores attribute data in a tabular format. This file uses the dBase format.

### ESRI Shapefile

In addition to these three mandatory files, there are several optional files that can accompany a shapefile:

- `.prj`: The projection file, which contains coordinate system and projection information.
- `.sbn` and `.sbx`: Spatial index files that improve the speed of spatial queries.
- `.fbn` and `.fbx`: Files used for spatial indexing of features that have been deleted.

### ESRI Shapefile

- `.ain` and `.aih`: Attribute index files that improve the speed of attribute queries.
- `.ixs` and `.mxs`: Geocoding index for read-write and read-only datasets, respectively.
- `.cpg`: The code page file, which specifies the character encoding used in the .dbf file.

- Import data with `read_sf()`

```


### Geospatial Data Formats: GeoJSON {.inverse}

### Geospatial Data Formats: GeoJSON

- One file with everything you need embedded within it

- [Import GeoJSON city council data from PortlandMaps Open Data](https://gis-pdx.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/2aec1ba28a6d47b790d59dd831f9bc76_1413/explore?location=45.485228%2C-122.289380%2C9.18)

---

```{r}
read_sf("data/Portland_City_Council_Districts.geojson")
```

### Geospatial Data Formats: Others

- Almost all file formats can be imported with `read_sf()`


### Your Turn {.your-turn}

- [Download data (ESRI Shapefile or GeoJSON) on Portland sextants](https://gis-pdx.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/PDX::portland-administrative-sextants/explore)

- Import the data in R using the `read_sf()` function from the `sf` package and save it as `portland_sextants`

- Examine `portland_sextants`, making sure you can identify its geometry type, dimensions, bounding box, coordinate reference system and `geometry` column
