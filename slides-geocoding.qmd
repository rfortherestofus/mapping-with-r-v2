Doesn't work for Number 10, which is transition to talking about `method` argument

### Your Turn {.your-turn}

- Create a tibble with the following starter code for your home address:

. . .

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| output-location: default

library(tidyverse)

my_address <-
  tribble(
    ~address,
    "Your address goes here"
  )
```

### Your Turn {.your-turn}

- Use the {tidygeocoder} package to geocode your address

- Turn the result into an `sf` object with `st_as_sf()` and plot it on a map with `mapview::mapview()` to make sure it worked
